# Preparation

The thought is that we will have four weekly "assignments" in the runup to the unconf itself.

We want to do this to give everyone a chance to arrive at the unconf in roughly the same shape, confident to get started.

We should emphasize that if *you* are experienced with RStudio, R, git, and GitHub, and you like your current set-up, please proceed undisturbed (as Jenny Bryan might say).

The current thought for the weekly assignments are:

- Week 0: [RStudio and GitHub](00-rstudio-github/README.md)
- Week 1: [R and git](01-r-git/README.md)
- Week 2: [devtools and Rtools](02-devtools-rtools/README.md)
- Week 3: [usethis, Github PAT and checkover](03-usethis/README.md)

Each "week" will have an entry on a page at the main Unconf site. Each week will also have a screencast demonstrating the tasks. 

The purpose of this part of the repository is for me to collect my thoughts, and to make xaringan presentations to use within the screencasts.
